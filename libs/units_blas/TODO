- Add concept docs specifying what types can be used within a units_blas matrix.  Include concepts for raw-numeric types a la the fundamenal numeric types, and other numeric types a la Boost.Units.

- Document rationale behind picking SFINAE over BOOST_MPL_ASSERTS in operations.  Remind users that when overload resolution fails, it's usually a matrix-dimensionality problem, whereas when something else fails deep in the implementation, it's usually a units problem.

- Eliminate dependency on native-typeof uses of BOOST_TYPEOF, and/or register units_blas types with BOOST_TYPEOF.

- Add support for complex value_types and associated complex-related functions, like herm(), real(), imag(), and conj().

- Add template expression optimizations using Boost.Proto.

- Do timing comparisons of units_blas vs. boost.ublas, and optimize where possible.

- Optimize build speed of library.
